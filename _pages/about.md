Welcome to my personal page, on which you can find different project I worked on.

Graduate from Arts et MÃ©tiers ParisTech (French global engineering school), I am finishing my post master degree at Telecom ParisTech in "big data and machine learning".
Passionate about mathematical, I found in artificial intelligence, a powerful application with limitless possibilities. I enjoy using it to solve real world problem. I am convinced that this technology can help us to meet the greatest challenges of this century.

Currently inter at Schlumberger (Houston, TX),  I remain open to any opportunity for the future. Please fill free to contact me.
